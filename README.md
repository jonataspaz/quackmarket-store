# 3D Enhanced Online Marketplace - A Dual Application Online Marketplace Platform

### The focus of this project is to improve the online shopping experience by introducing a platform that integrates 3D modelling technology. The marketplace is designed to enable sellers to showcase their items in a more dynamic and engaging way, thereby giving buyers a more realistic and immersive understanding of the products.

[Store Repository](https://github.com/jonataspaz/quackmarket-store)

### The project comprises two distinct applications. The first is an Admin Application dedicated to sellers, facilitating the addition of products alongside their respective 3D models. This unique feature allows sellers to offer potential customers a tangible, lifelike perspective of their products, transcending traditional product photographs


### The second component is the Store Application. It is built to fetch product data, including the 3D models, from the Admin API. Buyers can access this application to view and interact with the 3D models of products.
